3D Particle Tunnel
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple 3D particle tunnel effect using JavaScript and Three.js library.

Overview
This project creates a 3D scene with a camera and renders it using WebGL. Thousands of particles are generated randomly within a certain range and are displayed in a tunnel-like formation. The particles are constantly rotating to create an animated tunnel effect.

Usage
To use this project, simply include the index.js file in your HTML document along with the Three.js library. Ensure that the file paths are correct. Open the HTML file in a web browser, and you should see the 3D particle tunnel effect.

Dependencies
Three.js: A JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D computer graphics.
